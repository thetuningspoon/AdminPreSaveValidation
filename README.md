# Pre-Save Page Validation for ProcessWire
Prevents admin editors from saving changes to a page that has one or more invalid fields. This module uses an ajax call to check for errors and javascript to populate the page edit form with any error messages that were returned. This way the user can correct the issues and resubmit the form without invalid data getting saved to the database or the editor losing changes.
